This repository contains an implementation of fuzzy implicative rules and an algorithm to mine implicative association rules. The project focuses on generating and analyzing fuzzy rules based on fuzzy logic, which can be applied to various datasets for pattern discovery and decision-making processes. The implementation allows a custom selection of the fuzzy operators and fuzzy partitions.
